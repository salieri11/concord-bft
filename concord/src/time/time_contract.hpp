// Time Contract is a state machine run by each replica to combine timestamps
// from other replicas into a non-decreasing time that has some resilience to
// false readings.
//
// Optionally, the time contract can validate updates received from other time
// sources in order to protect against Byzantine-faulty sources forging updates
// from other sources. Two means of time verification are currently available,
// "rsa-time-signing", which adds an additional cryptographic signature to each
// time update to prove its legitimacy, and "bft-client-proxy-id", in which time
// samples are verified based on the Concord-BFT client proxy IDs from which the
// samples enter consensus (Concord-BFT should guarantee it is intractable to
// impersonate a client proxy without a public key belonging to it).
//
// One important note is that reconfiguration of a cluster after it has been
// deployed to switch to or from a time verification mechanism that employs
// signatures is NOT supported. That is, if any node in a cluster has run at all
// before, we explicitly leave the behavior resulting from changing the time
// verification mechanism after that point undefined (even if one stops every
// node in the cluster before making this change). A possible exception to this
// is that it may be possible to switch time verification schemes if both the
// scheme being switched from and the scheme being switched to do not employ
// signatures added to each time update. Switching to, from, or between schemes
// is non-trivial and currently left undefined because signatures for time
// samples are persisted when a signature-employing verification scheme is
// enabled.
//
// Readings are submitted as (source, time, signature) triples (if a
// signature-based time verification scheme is in use) or (source, time) pairs
// (otherwise), where source is a string identifier of the submitter, time is a
// timestamp represetnted as google::protobuf::Timestamp, and signature (if
// present) is a digital signature proving that this time sample actually
// originates from the named source (based on a public key given for that time
// source in this Concord cluster's configuration).
//
// Aggregation can be done via any statistical means that give the guarantees
// discussed above. The current implementation is to choose the median of the
// most recent readings. See TimeContract::SummarizeTime.
