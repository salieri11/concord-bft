# Currently, conc_genconfig (the Concord configuration generation utility) is
# statically linked so that it can be run while setting up and deploying Concord
# clusters from a machine that is not a Concord node without having to install
# any additional dependencies to that machine to run the conc_genconfig binary.
# As such, it needs to be linked with some static libraries, which we need to
# locate separately from the shared libraries since the static libraries are
# different files.
