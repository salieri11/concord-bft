# Thin Replica Client Library

Thin Replicas are a mechanism that may be used in VMware Blockchain Deployments
to support subscription-based streaming of updates from committer nodes (Concord
replica nodes) participating in consensus to participant nodes that do not
participate in consensus but host parties observing and/or transacting in the
blockchain maintained by the Concord cluster. The thin replica mechanism is also
designed to support limiting what updates the committer nodes allow a particular
participant node to see.

Please see the Thin Replica design spec on Confluence for a more detailed
explanation of the thin replica mechanism.

The thin replica mechanism uses a client/server model. The thin replica server
is a part of Concord that runs on the committer node. As the thin replica
mechanism is designed, the clients may be arbitrary application(s) that run on
participant nodes; we provide the Thin Replica Client Library for use by such
applications.

The interface to the Thin Replica Client Library is defined in the header file
`thin-replica-client/lib/thin_replica_client.hpp`. Comments with the definitions
in this file provide primary documentation of the interface.

At the time of this writing, the Thin Replica Client Library is still under
development and has not yet been fully implemented.

## Building the Thin Replica Client Library

The Thin Replica Client Library can be built with Docker. To build an image with
the header files and binaries needed to use this library (note this command is
to be run in the `vmwathena_blockchain` repository, one directory above where
this README is):

```
vmwathena_blockchain$ docker build -f thin-replica-client/Dockerfile . \
                                   -t trc-lib:latest
```

As it is anticipated applications consuming the Thin Replica Client Library will
be Dockerized, using Docker images of the Thin Replica Client Library built like
this as input to the Docker build of applications in order to obtain the
library's outward-facing header files and binaries is considered to be the
officially supported means of consuming this library at a build level.

CI for our project repository should regularly push builds of this image from
the `master` branch to Artifactory, tagged with a build number. Targeting a
specific artifact by build number as input to an application's Docker build is
recommended in order to maximize reproducability of application builds.

## Example Thin Replica Application

We provide an example application using the Thin Replica Client Library. The
example application is also intended to serve as a basic end-to-end test.

The example application first retrieves initial state visible to the Thin
Replica Client via the `ReadState` and `ReadStateHash` RPC calls, which are
triggered by calling ThinReplicaClient::Subscribe function (which pushes all
initial state to the update queue before returning); the application tries to
acknowledge the initial state after receiving it. Once the application has
exhausted the initial state, it will switch to waiting for additional updates to
arrive in the queue (via the subscription created by the
`ThinReplicaClient::Subscribe` call), printing messages in real time as they are
received, and trying to acknowledge those updates. In order to demonstrate and
test the `ThinReplicaClient::Unsubscribe` call and the graceful stop of a
subscription, the example application will automatically unsubscribe and exit
after a fixed number of updates are received.

It might be noted that update acknowledgement and unsubscription are not yet
supported end-to-end (server-side implementaitons are currently lacking);
however, placeholders are in place on the Thin Replica Client Library side, so
applications can already by written making these calls as that they ought to
make them once they run end-to-end. The Thin Replica Client example application
includes these calls to the library functions.

### Building and Running the Example Application

The example application is built with Docker from a Docker image of the Thin
Replica Client Library (see "Building the Thin Replica Client Library" above).
By default, the example application build targets a library build at
`trc-lib:latest`. If you have built or tagged a Thin Replica Client Library
image as such on your machine, then from the `vmwathena_blockchain` directory
(one directory above the `thin-replica-client` directory this README file is
in), the Thin Replica Client example application can be built with:

```
~/vmwathena_blockchain$ docker build . \
                                     -f thin-replica-client/DockerfileExample \
				     -t trc-example:latest
```

Docker build arguments can be used to target a different Docker image for the
build of the example application. For example, from the `vmwathena_blockchain`
directory (one above the `thin-replica-client` directory this README file is
in), the Thin Replica Client example application can be built targeting a Thin
Replica Client Library Image uploaded to
`athena-docker-local.artifactory.eng.vmware.com/trc-lib` with tag `1024` with:

```
~/vmwathena_blockchain$ docker build . \
                                     -f thin-replica-client/DockerfileExample \
				     -t trc-example:latest \
				     --build-arg \
         "trc_lib_repo=athena-docker-local.artifactory.eng.vmware.com/trc-lib" \
	                             --build-arg "trc_lib_tag=1024"
```

To run the example Thin Replica Client application and connect it to a local
Concord development cluster:

Configure and launch the DAML Nano `docker-compose` cluster:

```
~/vmwathena_blockchain/docker$ ./gen-docker-concord-config.sh \
        config-public/dockerConfigurationInput-daml-nano.yml
~/vmwathena_blockchain/docker$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-daml-nano.yml up
```

Clearing the contents of `docker/devdata` is recommended after reconfiguring the
cluster.

In order for the example application to successfully read any initial state from
a DAML cluster, the cluster needs application-level DAML state retrievable via
the Thin Replica mechanism. Running DAML-specific Hermes tests against your
cluster can provide a convenient way to trigger the creation of relevant state,
for example:

```
~/vmwathena_blockchain/hermes$ python3 -m pytest suites/thin_replica_server_tests.py --noLaunch
```

To run the Thin Replica Client example application in a container that can
connect to the cluster launched in the previous step:

```
~/vmwathena_blockchain$ docker run --rm --network docker_default \
                                   trc-example:latest
```

Here is an example of what the initial output from the example application might
be expected to look like if everything works as expected:

```

Note that `<SOME LINES OMITTED FOR CONCISION>` is not actually expected in the
output; it has been added to this example as part of an edit to actual output to
reduce excessive repetition in the actual output.

The example application should not immediately terminate on its own after this
initial output; if any additional DAML state that ought to be visible to the
Thin Replica Client is generated, then additional output should be expected in
real time for the generated updates. The example application will wait to
receive a fixed number of updates before attempting to unsubscribe and
terminating (128 updates in the example output here; which sounds like a lot,
though it should not take too long as the time service causes the generation of
a steady stream of empty updates). In order to demonstrate the Thin Replica
Client Library's support for resuming a stopped subscription via a saved Block
ID, the example application will destroy and reconstruct its Thin Replica Client
object half way through this fixed number of updates, then try to re-subscribe
with the last Block ID it received before destroying its first client.

Here is an example of what some of the additional output from updates received in real time might look like:

```

Here is an example of what the point in the output might look like at which the
example application destroys and reconstructs its Thin Replica Client object and
tries to resume its existing subscription:

Here is an example of how the output might conclude once the example application
receives its fixed number of updates and unsubscribes:
