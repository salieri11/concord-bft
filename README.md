# VMware Blockchain

This is the code for the VMware blockchain. It is broken into a few
components:

 * Concord: the blockchain replica node
 * EthRPC: a translator from Web3 JSON RPC to Concord protobuf
 * Helen: the API server
 * Hermes: the integration test framework
 * Persephone: the deployment engine / fleet management service
 * UI: the browser-based UI for interacting with Helen

## Skipping the Build

If you want to experiment with VMW Blockchain without building the
components yourself, please use the instructions found on (the Docker
page of the Blockchain Confluence
site)[https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/BLOC/Docker] to use
pre-built images produced by our CI/CD pipeline.

## Building via Docker

The easiest way to use this system is via docker. Please install the
(community edition)[https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/].

> Note: The build instructions listed here was verified with Docker
> 18.09+. There are known issues with the current set of build
> instructions with Docker on Linux at version 18.06 and possibly
> other prior versions as well. Please update Docker to 18.09+ before
> proceeding, regardless of the host platform, to minimize potential
> incompatibilities.

If you are running linux, you will also need to install
(docker-compose)[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/]. If you're
running Mac OS or Windows, docker-compose was installed with docker.

### Sign into Artifactory

We have cached some of the build environments in docker images on
Artifactory. You will need access to those to run our build
scripts. So, ensure that you log your docker daemon into Artifactory
before continuing:

```
$ docker login -u <your vmware username without @vmware.com> \
               athena-docker-local.artifactory.eng.vmware.com
```

### Getting the Code

When you clone the repository, include `--recursive` or
`--recurse-submodules` to get the submodule dependencies as well:

```
$ git clone --recursive \
      git@gitlab.eng.vmware.com:blockchain/vmwathena_blockchain.git
```

If you cloned without recursing through submodules, you can set them
up by running the following commands in the root directory of your
cloned repository:

```
blockchain$ git submodule init
blockchain$ git submodule update
```

### Building everything at once

With docker installed, please run the "buildall.sh" script found in
the root directory of the repository:

```
blockchain$ ./buildall.sh

If the script completes successfully, you can skip the rest of this
Building section, and start Testing. If any of the components failed
to build, or you want to rebuild one of them, please see the following
subsections for information on how to build each component
individually.

### Building Concord via Docker

*Note*: If you did not include `--recursive` or `--recurse-submodules`
in your original git-clone instruction, you will need to run
`git submodule init && git submodule update` before building concord.
If you do not, the build will fail with an error about
`/concord/submodules/concord-bft` not containing a CMakeLists.txt file.

Concord can be built directly in a docker container (note the command
is run from the same directory as this README, and *not* from the
`concord` subdirectory):

```
blockchain$ docker build -f concord/Dockerfile . -t concord-core:latest
```

### Building EthRPC via Docker

EthRPC can be built directly in a docker container (note the command
is run from the same directory as this README, and *not* from the
`ethrpc` subdirectory):

```
blockchain$ docker build . -f ethrpc/Dockerfile -t ethrpc:latest
```

### Building Helen via Docker

Helen can be built directly in a docker container (note the command
is run from the same directory as this README, and *not* from the
`helen` subdirectory):

```
blockchain$ docker build . -f helen/Dockerfile -t helen:latest
```

Helen can also be built much faster in the lite mode by using a
prebuilt .jar file from `helen/target` by running the following
command from the same directory as this README, and *not* from the
`helen` subdirectory):

```
blockchain$ docker build . -f helen/Dockerfile-lite -t helen:latest
```

### Building Hermes via Docker

Hermes does not need to be built before being used. See notes later
for how to use Hermes to test your images.

### Building UI via Docker

The UI is built directly in a docker container (note the command is
run from the same directory as this README, and not from the `ui`
subdirectory):

```
blockchain$ docker build ui -f ui/Dockerfile -t ui:latest
```

### Building Contract Compiler via Docker

The Contract Compiler is built directly in a docker container (note the command is
run from the same directory as this README, and not from the `contract-compiler`
subdirectory):

```
blockchain$ docker build contract-compiler -f contract-compiler/Dockerfile -t contract-compiler:latest
```

### Building Fluentd

Fluentd is build directly in a docker container (note the command is
run from the same directory as this README, and not from
`docker/fluentd`:

```
blockchain$ docker build persephone/fluentd -f persephone/fluentd/Dockerfile -t fluentd:latest
```

### Building Agent via Docker

concord-agent can be built directly in a docker container (note the docker build
command is run from the subdirectoy persephone):
Please note this is just temporary.
Credentials for pushing to docker-hub are different from regular user.

```
blockchain$ cd persephone
blockchain$ docker build . -f agent/Dockerfile -t vmwblockchain/agent-testing:latest
```
If you want to push to the docker-hub:
```
docker push vmwblockchain/agent-testing
```

### Building Persephone via Docker

Persephone, the deployment service for VMware Blockchain, is itself composed of
a number of distinct microservices which can be built directly in Docker
containers. Note not all Persephone microservices' build processes are
documented here.

#### Building Persephone Configuration Service via Docker
The Persephone Configuration Service can be built directly in a Docker
container. As the Persephone Configuration Service requires the binary for the
Concord Configuration Generation Utility from Concord, the Persephone
Configuration Service's build requires a Concord image (the image for the
version of Concord this build of the configuration service will target deploying
should be used).

(note all commands to build the Persephone Configuration Service given in this
immediate subsection are run from the same directory as this README, and *not*
from the `persephone` or `persephone/config-service` directories)

You must target specific Concord images for the Persephone Configuration
Service Build via build arguments. For example, to build
`persephone-configuration:latest` `concord-core` version `0.0.0.2601` from Artifactory:
```
blockchain$ docker build -f persephone/config-service/Dockerfile -t \
    persephone-configuration:latest --build-arg \
    "concord_repo=athena-docker-local.artifactory.eng.vmware.com/concord-core" \
    --build-arg "concord_tag=0.0.0.2601"
```
You can find the latest published tags of concord-core in the repository here: 
[athena-docker-local](https://athena-docker-local.artifactory.eng.vmware.com/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/athena-docker-local/concord-core)

### Building the Thin Replica Client Library via Docker

The Thin Replica Client Library can be built directly in a docker container. The
Thin Replica Client Library is not itself a runnable application or
microservice, but building it via docker (or pulling an existing image of it
from Artifactory) is currently the canonical means we support for obtaining
include files and binaries for the Thin Replica Client Library for use in
building applications consuming the library. For this reason, you do not
necessarily need an image of the Thin Replica Client Library Docker image to run
the product unless you are locally building other images that are dependent on
this library. To build the Thin Replica Client Library Docker Image (note this
command is run from the same directory as this README, and *not* from the
`thin-replica-client` subdirectory):

```
blockchain$ docker build -f thin-replica-client/Dockerfile . -t trc-lib:latest
```

### Building Natively

It is technically possible to build each component outside of Docker if you have
set up and configured your machine/build environment/toolchain in a way that is
sufficiently compatible with the Dockerized build. For some components, native
builds are even explicitly supported. If a component explicitly supports native
builds, then native build instructions should be available in the README file
for that component's subdirectory in this repository.

For the Java-based subprojects, the following "Alternative" instructions for
using a dockerized Maven can also be helpful.

#### Alternative Build Steps for Maven-build Components

The easiest way to build all Maven-build components (currently
`communication`, `ethrpc`, and `helen`) without installing any
toolchain is to trigger the build within a Docker container.
In addition, to leverage the build cache so subsequent builds
can be faster, it is advisable to create a container volume to
house all incrementally-built and downloaded artifacts. This
section will walk through step-by-step on how to go from ground
zero to having the relevant Docker images built.

Step 1: Create the Docker volume.

Here we create a container volume named `mvn-repo`.
```
blockchain$ docker volume create --name mvn-repo
```

Step 2: Invoke top-level build to trigger all sub-builds via Docker.

Here we create a container named `mvn-build`, with current directory
(blockchain/) and the `mvn-repo` container volume mounted. The
container starts the entry-point at `/workspace` which is mounted
to our host's current directory. Finally `mvn` command is triggered
to build and archive all the built artifacts into the `mvn-repo`
volume.

```
blockchain$ docker run \
              --rm --name mvn-build \
              -v maven-repo:/root/.m2 \
              -v "$(pwd)":/workspace \
              -w /workspace maven:3.6.0-jdk-11 \
              mvn clean install
```

Step 3: Create the Docker images.

This step just performs the equivalent sub-steps in the default build
steps (i.e. non-alternative) to create the relevant docker images.

```
blockchain$ docker build ethrpc -f ethrpc/packaging.Dockerfile -t ethrpc:latest
blockchain$ docker build helen -f helen/packaging.Dockerfile -t helen:latest
```

## Testing

Once your containers are built, run the tests using hermes:

- Usage:
```
blockchain/hermes$ sudo python -m pytest --help <TEST_MODULE_NAME>
```
- Example
```
blockchain/hermes$ sudo python -m pytest suites/sample_suite.py
```
- Available options (--help)
```
blockchain/hermes$ python -m pytest --help
usage: __main__.py [options] [file_or_dir] [file_or_dir] [...]

positional arguments:
  file_or_dir

general:
  -k EXPRESSION         only run tests which match the given substring expression. 
                        An expression is a python evaluatable expression where all names 
                        are substring-matched against test names and their parent classes.
                        Example: -k 'test_method or test_other' matches all test functions 
                        and classes whose name contains 'test_method' or 'test_other', 
                        while -k 'not test_method' matches those that don't contain 'test_method' 
                        in their names. -k 'not test_method and not test_other' will eliminate 
                        the matches. Additionally keywords are matched to classes and functions
                        containing extra names in their 'extra_keyword_matches' set, as well 
                        as functions which have names assigned directly to them. The matching
                        is case-insensitive.
  -m MARKEXPR           only run tests matching given mark expression.
                        For example: -m 'mark1 and not mark2'.
  --markers             show markers (builtin, plugin and per-project ones).
  -x, --exitfirst       exit instantly on first error or failed test.
  --maxfail=num         exit after first num failures or errors.

reporting:
  --durations=N         show N slowest setup/test durations (N=0 for all).
  --json=JSON_PATH      where to store the JSON report
  --jsonapi             make the report conform to jsonapi


reporting:
  --alluredir=DIR       Generate Allure report in the specified directory (may not exist)

Concord Options::

                        launching and launch with the newly generated configuration files. 
                        If this option is not given, then
                        configuration generation will be skipped and the currently existing 
                        configuration files will be used.
  --concordConfigurationInput=CONCORDCONFIGURATIONINPUT
                        The input file to the configuration generation utility. 
                        Note: --runConcordConfigurationGeneration has to be set. 
                        Note: The path specified is the absolute path within a 
                        Concord container.

  --ethrpcApiUrl=ETHRPCAPIURL
                        By default, Helen's getMembers API is used to fetch ethrpc 
                        nodes, and test cases randomly select nodes from that pool.  
                        To force use of one node, or to use an official Ethereum setup, 
                        specify its url here.  e.g. 'http://localhost:8545'.

                        (e.g. 'vmwareguest') if you must use a different port and
