To build the VMware Blockchain Orchestrator appliance:

1. Prepare a Common Appliance Platform (CAP) environment as described here:
https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CPDVC&title=CAP+-+Getting+Started

2. The following assumes you have your CAP environment under the $CommonAppliancePlatform directory.

3. Copy the following files from this directory to $CommonAppliancePlatform

    blockchain.service
    orchestrator-appliance-customizations.json
    orchestrator-appliance-remote.json
    orchestrator-prereqs-launcher.sh
    post-install-castor.sh

4. Modify the configuration/repositories/local json 
   entry in orchestrator-appliance-remote.json to point to the absolute path for $CommonAppliancePlatform.

5. Update the docker containers version for Castor services in 
    ONPREM_BLOCKCHAIN_VERSION
   in post-install-castor.sh

6. cd $CommonAppliancePlatform

7. Init the cap tool:
    ./cap init

8. Remove any previously built images, and old log files:
    rm -rf images/* logs/*

9. Remove any vmware-blockchain-appliance VMs on the target vCenter.

10. Build the OVF:
    ./cap build -f orchestrator-appliance-remote.json

11. The new OVF should be available under $CommonAppliancePlatform/images.
